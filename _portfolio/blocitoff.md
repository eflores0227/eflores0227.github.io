short-description: Blocitoff is a self-destructing to-do list application. Once a user checks off something from their personal to-do list it is deleted.

---
#### Summary
Blocitoff aims to keep to-do lists manageable by automatically deleting to-do items that have not been completed after seven days. The assumption being if the to-do item is not important enough to be completed in seven days, it doesn't belong on your to-do list.

#### User Story

* Be able to mark to-do items as complete and have them deleted.

title: My Journey With Bloc
---
Coming with a background as an Administrative Assistant for a agricultural company, and little to no knowledge of web development, Bloc really helped me learn everything I needed to know to get started in the industry and establish a love for it.

I am not going to sugarcoat it, this course has been tough. While I was excited to take on the challenge of learned a new skill exclusively online, it was a bit frightening. I had taken online classes before but not one so intense. I had done a Skillcrush course on frontend web development prior to Bloc but, this was the first time I had a mapped timeline, this was the real deal. Bloc made the transition easy by providing a mentor for every step of the way and it helped tremendously. As soon as I had gotten through the initial shock and asking the question, "Is this really for me?", I fell in love. I loved the feeling that I was building something from scratch that I could show people. There is something so satisfying about doing something so small, like adding "Hello World" to your first project and seeing it displayed on your local host.

The frontend course was when I really realized this was something I could do forever. Don't get me wrong, the backend course and using Rails was fun and exciting but, I needed something a little more creative. Going from Ruby to Javascript was a bit of an adjustment and, sooner rather than later it was second nature. I thoroughly enjoyed creating web applications that were both functional and aesthetically pleasing.  

This was the hardest part in my journey to becoming a software engineer, the software engineering principles. I learned a lot about how I learn during this part. I learned that I like writing my code on a whiteboard before implementing anything I also learned that I need to visualize what is actually happening when it comes to more complex aspects. In my head I would imagine binary trees because seeing the code alone was hard for me to actually interpret. I started drawing pictures next to the steps in my code so I could solve the problems more easily.

At the end of the all, I learned not only how to program and think like a developer, but how to learn like a developer. I loved every bit of it and appreciate the help I received from my mentor and the experience I gained from learning software engineering from Bloc. I am looked forward to learn more and pursue my new passion.

title: My journey with Bloc
---
Coming from a background in Cosmetology, and little to no knowledge of web development, Bloc really helped me learn everything I needed to know to get started in the industry and establish a love for it.

* Rails Development
* Frontend Development
* Software Engineering Principles
* Open source

I am not going to sugarcoat it, this course has been tough. Working completely online was, personally, terrifying. I had taken online classes before but not one so intense. I had done a Skillcrush course on frontend web development prior to Bloc but, this was the first time I had a mapped timeline, this was the real deal. Bloc made the transition easy by providing a mentor for every step of the way and it helped tremendously. As soon as I had gotten through the initial shock and asking the question, "Is this really for me?", I fell in love. I loved the feeling that I was building something from scratch that I could show people. There is something so satisfying about doing something so small, like adding "Hello World" to your first project and seeing it displayed on your local host.

The frontend course was when I really realized this was something I could do forever. Don't get me wrong, the backend course and using Rails was fun and exciting but, I needed something a little more creative. Going from Ruby to Javascript was a bit of an adjustment and, sooner rather than later it was second nature. I thoroughly enjoyed creating web applications that were both functional and aesthetically pleasing.  

Excuse my French but, holy shit, this was the hardest part in my journey to becoming a software engineer.

<h3>Hi, my name is Estefania Flores and I want to learn everything about everything.</h3>
<p>Born in a small town in the Central Valley of California, ready to take on the tech world of Northern California.
<p>I recently finished a bootcamp in software engineering through Bloc.io. I learned principles necessary to be a quality developer and provide accessible web applications.
<p>I strongly believe that learning never stops. Everything can always be improved and I am passionate about learning new ways to be able to improve projects.
